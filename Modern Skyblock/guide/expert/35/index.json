To make a Ludicrite Ingots, you will first need to make the block from Enderium and Blutonium, smelt it in a Magma Crucible or a Smeltery with Blazing Pyrotheum and then cast it into the Ingots. To make Tungstensteel, you need a multiblock Industrial Blast Furnace with a frame made out of Advanced Machine Casing, filled with Lava.",
