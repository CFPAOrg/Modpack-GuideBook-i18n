#Quest
continuum.logs.name=I'm a Lumberjack and I'm OK
continuum.logs.desc=Like pretty much every modpack, you start with punching trees. Now, making planks through crafting only gives you 2 planks instead of 4, and you can only craft vanilla planks. To get more planks, or planks from modded trees, you have to use the Sawmill.\n\nThis quest will work with any wood type.

continuum.efab.name=EFab-ulous
continuum.efab.desc=The EFab is a new modular multiblock machine that works like an advanced crafting table. Several items are only craftable through the EFab. To start with, you only need the EFab Crafting Grid.\n\nTo get Stone tools (which use Flint, not Cobblestone) or better, you must have the Armory Upgrade installed. Craft the Armory Upgrade then place it inside one of the 9 upgrade slots under the crafting grid in the EFab GUI. Other recipes may require blocks like the Gear Box added to the multiblock instead of upgrades put into the Efab Crafting Grid.\n\nThe multiblock can be extended with EFab Bases. Blocks in the multiblock do not have to directly touch the EFab Crafting Grid, they just have to be touching another EFab block that §ois.§o§r§r\n\nAlso notice that some recipes require time as well as materials to craft. This time can be decreased by having multiple Gear Boxes, Pipes, Steam Engines, or RF Controls, depending on the recipe you want to speed up. If a recipe uses more than one of these, it always takes the highest speed multiplier in the multiblock.

continuum.tinkering.name=Tinkering
continuum.tinkering.desc=Now that the EFab is set up, we can get started with Tinkers' Construct. While you techically only need 6 Blank Patterns to make all the blocks and a functioning Pickaxe, you should make a few more.

continuum.smeltery.name=Meltery
continuum.smeltery.desc=The Smeltery is a multiblock that allows you to make alloys, metal tool parts, and gears at the cost of Lava as fuel.\n\nPut metals into the Smeltery, either as ores or ingots, and they will slowly be smelted into molten metal. A single ore will only smelt into a single ingot\u0027s worth of that metal. Some molten metals will alloy with each other, so be careful not to smelt them at the same time if you don\u0027t want that alloy. To get the molten metal out of the Smeltery, you need to pour it into a Cast on a Casting Table or pour 9 ingots worth into a Casting Basin to get a block of that metal. \n\nThere are Casts for every tool part type as well as Ingots, Nuggets, Gems, and Gears. To make a Cast, pour either 2 ingots of Molten Gold, 1 ingot of Molten Brass, or 1 ingot of Molten Aluminum Brass onto a part of the type you want to make a Cast of. This will destroy the part.\n\nThe blocks required by this quest will allow you to make a 3x3x1 interior Smeltery. The Smeltery can have up to a 7x7x7 interior. Each block of empty space in the interior is another item or block you can put into the Smeltery, and 8 more ingots of fluid storage.\n\nIt is recommended to start the Smeltery Controller early, as it takes 10 minutes to craft in the EFab using only one Gear Box.

continuum.lunch_box.name=Diversity is the Spice of Life
continuum.lunch_box.desc=Thanks to the mod "The Spice of Life", eating the same food too often will make that food give you less, forcing you to diversify your diet.\n\nThe Lunch Box allows you to keep up to 6 different foods, up to 2 of each for a total of 6 foods, in a single item. Use it while it's closed to open the GUI and insert the foods. Use it while sneaking to open it. You can directly eat out of an open Lunch Box by using it.

continuum.cooking.name=I'm the Cook
continuum.cooking.desc=As we have "The Spice of Life", we're going to need a lot of different foods. "Cooking for Blockheads" is a mod that helps make crafting foods a lot easier. It adds a multiblock kitchen that you can store your ingredients and tools and quickly make food at. All the blocks must be touching themselves, and you can use the Kitchen Floor to connect blocks that aren't close to each other.\n\nThe Cooking Table is the block that has the crafting GUI. It accesses foods and ingredients that are in Kitchen Counters or Fridges that are a part of the multiblock.\n\nIf a Sink is a part of the kitchen, it will also be able to do recipes that require Water (the Sink also works as an infinite Water source for Buckets and pipes).\n\nIt will be able to use Pam's Harvestcraft's tools if they are placed in Tool Racks.\n\nThe Oven allows you to use furnace recipes as well as crafting recipes. It must be supplied with Coal or other burnables to work. It can also smelt up to 9 items at once.\n\nIf you also want to have Milk, you can use either the Milk Jar or the Cow in a Jar. The Milk Jar uses any Milk it has inside it, and is manually filled by using a Bucket of Milk on it. The Cow in a Jar however slowly generates Milk infinitely. Both store up to 8 buckets of Milk.

continuum.coke_oven.name=Baking Bad
continuum.coke_oven.desc=The Coke Oven is a multiblock machine that turns 1 Coal into 1 Coal Coke and 500 mB of Creosote Oil. To make it, place a 3x3x3 of Coke Brick in the world and right-click an Engineer's Hammer on the middle of the face you want the front of the Coke Oven to be.\n\nTo make Treated Wood in the EFab, part of the multiblock must be a Tank. Tanks can store up to 16,000mB of a single fluid. You can have multiple Tanks within a single EFab structure and they can have separate fluids. Tanks stacked on top of each other will attatch and combine their storage space.

continuum.forestry_machine.name=Not Really for Wood
continuum.forestry_machine.desc=The Carpenter is a machine that uses RF to craft from recipes, which can also use fluids. In the crafting grid, set the recipe by clicking items in the proper slots. The items do not actually go in the crafting grid, they go in the 18 storage slots and get used up as the Carpenter crafts.\n\nThe Thermionic Fabricator is another machine that uses RF to melt Glass and use it to make Electron Tubes, among other things. Place Sand or Glass in the top left slot and it will melt it at the cost of RF. It is otherwise used similar to the Carpenter as far as crafting goes.

continuum.atomic_reconstructor.name=Technological Transmutation
continuum.atomic_reconstructor.desc=The Atomic Reconstructor uses CF (which is the same as RF and FE, just another name) to change certain things into certain other things.\n\nPlace the machine down facing the direction you want the laser to go to. The laser itself does not change items, it changes items in a small area around the block the laser hits. By default, it is set so that a Redstone signal will turn the Atomic Reconstructor off; it will fire the laser as often as it can so long as there is nothing turning it off and it has power. It is recommended to right-click the machine with a Redstone Torch, which turns it into Pulse Mode, and it will not fire unless given a Redstone signal.\n\nHit U while hovering over the Atomic Reconstructor to see its uses.

continuum.yabba.name=YABBA Dabba Doo
continuum.yabba.desc=Barrels store large amounts of a single item and keep their contents when broken. Right click on a barrel to store the item you're holding, or hold right click to store all of that item from your inventory. Punch to pull one item out, and sneak punch to pull out a stack. You can sneak right click on a Barrel to open it's GUI and modify its settings.\n\nYou can use the Barrel Hammer to change the model of the Barrel. The Barrel Painter allows you to change the texture of the Barrel. Sneak right click the tools to open their GUIs and select the model or texture you wish, then right click on the Barrel to apply it.\n\nBy default, a Barrel can store up to 4096 items. You can upgrade the tier, multiplying the storage capacity by 4 times the previous tier, up to 262,144 items with the Diamond Tier upgrade. After that you can install the Infinite Capacity upgrade which removes the maximum limit entirely.\n\nThere's also a Hopper Upgrade which allows you to automatically pull from the top face and push into the bottom face like a Hopper, and adds the option to pick up item entities on the top face. The Collect Pickups upgrade will make it work like a single item backpack, automatically moving items you pick up into the Barrel if there's room; it's very useful for keeping Cobblestone clutter down early game. The Void Items upgrade allows you to insert items while full, destroying the item in the process. This is useful for Barrels that hold Cobblestone, as you can still put Cobblestone in it when it's full instead of throwing it in a corner.\n\nThe Item Barrel Connector allows you to access all Barrels touching either the IBC or Barrels that §oare §rthrough pipes and other automation. Open its GUI and you can remotely open the settings for other Barrels.\n\nThe AntiBarrel works like the polar opposite of a Barrel. It holds infinite amounts of items that do not stack. You cannot store items that would normally stack.

continuum.drawer.name=Stock Cupboards
continuum.drawer.desc=Storage Drawers come in 3 varieties: they can hold either 1, 2, or 4 different items. They all store up to 32 stacks by default, which is split equally between the amount of slots it has. Half Drawers hold half as much. You can open the GUI by sneak right clicking the Storage Drawer to apply upgrades.\n\nThere are several upgrades Drawers can have. Storage Upgrades increase the storage capacity of a Drawer. They do not require the previous tier and you can have multiple of the same tier at once. The Drawer Key will lock or unlock a Drawer, so that only what is currently inside it can ever be inserted into it, even when emptied.\n\nThe Compacting Drawer is special in that it shows the higher and lower versions of the item you place inside it. For example, if you placed a Gold Ingot inside, it would show Gold Nuggets and Gold Blocks as well. You are also able to pull any of the 3 out if you have enough of that item inside.\n\nThe Drawer Controller allows you to interact with all connected Drawers through pipes or other automation. Drawers that are touching the Drawer Controller (or Drawers that are touching Drawers that are, etc) are connected. You can use Controller Slaves as extensions of the Drawer Controller if you run out of faces to interact with. You can manually insert items into connected Drawers through the Drawer Controller like you would normally, but you cannot manually extract items through it.

continuum.clockwork_engine.name=Cranking Up the Heat
continuum.clockwork_engine.desc=The only RF generator you can make so far is the Clockwork Engine. It uses no fuel, but it needs to be manually wound. As you wind it by holding right click on it, it will increase in heat, as you can tell from the color change. If you let it get to red hot, it will start damaging you, so don't get too overzealous with it. Once you let go, it will start generating RF as it cools down. The hotter it is, the more RF/t it produces. You won't be able to pipe RF for a while, you have to place the Clockwork Engine next to the machines you want to use until you get better generators and Fluxducts. \n\nYou can get a Gear Cast by pouring Gold or Aluminum Brass onto a Wooden Gear with a Smeltery.

continuum.empowerer.name=A Certain Scientific Infusion Altar
continuum.empowerer.desc=The Empowerer is a multiblock machine that uses RF to combine 5 items into 1. The Empowerer itself should be placed in the middle of a + shape of Display Stands, with 2 blocks in between the Display Stands and the Empowerer. Give the Display Stands RF and put the correct items in each of the Stands and the Empowerer, and it will start the crafting process.

continuum.grindstone.name=Arm's Length, Please
continuum.grindstone.desc=The Quartz Grindstone allows you to double your ores by using the Crank while ores are inside. Grinding an ore does not have a 100 percent chance to double ores, and is §overy§o §rslow and cannot be automated.

continuum.te_sawmill.name=Really for Wood
continuum.te_sawmill.desc=Thermal Expansion's Sawmill allows you to get 4 Planks per log, as well as unlocking Planks from non-vanilla logs. Simply supply RF, stick some logs in there, and watch the Planks flow.

continuum.update_quests.name=Update quests
continuum.update_quests.desc=This quest is for when the modpack updates, and will update the quests and rewards. Click the checbox to the right, then claim both command rewards.

continuum.workshop_table.name=Work Station
continuum.workshop_table.desc=The Workshop Table has 4 slots for either Crafting Tables or Furnaces, which means you can use them all at the same time. In the "Upgrades" tab, you can set which quarter has the Furnaces or Crafting Tables. Items stay inside the Workshop Table when you close it.\n\nYou can apply a single Storage Upgrade to each Crafting Table slot, giving it 6 items for it to use. When crafting with a Storage Upgrade installed, items will be pulled out of the 6 slots instead of the crafting grid.

continuum.coal_generator.name=Old King Coal
continuum.coal_generator.desc=Now that we have the Carpenter, and thus Circuit Boards, there are some better RF generators you can make. These use Coal and other burnables rather than manual winding, so they can make RF while you\u0027re gone.\n\nThe Coal Generator makes less RF than the Survival Generator, but it has higher RF generation speed. The Survival Generator makes more than 1.5x as much RF, but it does so much slower.\n\nBoth of these Generators will keep their RF if broken.

continuum.fluxduct.name=Flowing Power
continuum.fluxduct.desc=Leadstone Fluxducts are the first way you will be able to transfer power from a source of RF to a machine. Place them in such a way that they connect the two, and RF will transfer through it.\n\nThe Leadstone Fluxduct can only transfer 1,000 RF/t per connection, while the Hardened Fluxduct can transfer 4,000 RF/t.

continuum.engineers_manual.name=Lexica Technica
continuum.engineers_manual.desc=The Engineer's Manual is the guidebook for Immersive Engineering. It has detailed instructions on what things do and how they work. Any recipes changed for this pack may not be reflected inside.\n\nThis quest only triggers when the book is open to the first page.

continuum.crude_blast_furnace.name=Harder, Better
continuum.crude_blast_furnace.desc=The Crude Blast Furnace allows you to create Steel. Create a 3x3x3 cube of Blast Brick and use an Engineer's Hammer on the middle block of the face you wish the front to be.\n\nYou cannot automatically pull from or push into a Crude Blast Furnace. You need to use Coal Coke as fuel to turn the Iron into Steel.

continuum.improved_blast_furnace.name=Faster
continuum.improved_blast_furnace.desc=The Improved Blast Furnace allows you to automate the production of Steel. Coal Coke and Iron can be pushed in through the top face, Steel comes out through the front, and Slag comes out through the back. It is constructed similar to the Crude Blast Furnace, but using Reinforced Blast Brick instead and a Hopper on top.\n\nOn either side of the Improved Blast Furnace, you can have Blast Furnace Preheaters to speed up the process at the cost of RF. At the cost of 32 RF/t, they will each speed it up by 100 percent, at the maximum of 3 times fast with both Preheaters at the cost of 64 RF/t. RF is provided at the top of the Preheater.\n\nThe Improved Blast Furnace is 3x4x3 (3x4x5 with both Preheaters installed).

continuum.tree_fluid_extractor.name=Tree Juice
continuum.tree_fluid_extractor.desc=The Tree Fluid Extractor extracts tree fluids. Namely, Latex. Place the Tree Fluid Extractor so that it faces a log, and it will slowly generate Latex with no RF cost. It has a chance to destroy the log, and that chance increases every time a bit of Latex is extracted from that log. It is a good idea to stock up on a lot of Latex.

continuum.conveyor.name=Here to There
continuum.conveyor.desc=Conveyor Belts are the earliest way you can move items automatically (aside from Hoppers). Place them in the world and they will move items that are on top of them in the direction they are facing. They will push into an inventory if they can, but you need a Hopper (or other automation) to pull from one.\n\nThere are several kinds of Conveyor Belt. The Dropping Conveyor Belt will drop items through it if there is no block under it, or insert items into an inventory under it if it can. The Vertical Conveyor Belt will move items straight up. The Splitting Conveyor Belt will make items turn left or right, alternating per item stack that passes through it. Covered Conveyor Belts will prevent items from being picked up off of it by the player.

continuum.schematic.name=Hologramic
continuum.schematic.desc=The Projector allows you to see multiblock blueprints in the world. Open your Engineer's Manual to the multiblock you want to see and then exit it. Crafting the Projector with the Engineer's Manual that's opened to a multiblock's page will set the Projector to that multiblock. \n\nWhile holding a Projector that's set to a multiblock, you can decide where you want it to go. Click the scroll wheel to rotate the blueprint, and right click to place the blueprint, which puts down "ghost" blocks that aren't really there and can be replaced with the real blocks by placing them normally. After the multiblock is finished, sneak right click the Projector to get the ghost blocks to disappear.

continuum.metal_press.name=Pressing Matters
continuum.metal_press.desc=The Metal Press is a multiblock machine that allows you to turn ingots into gears, plates, wires, and rods automatically. See the Engineer\u0027s Manual or a projector for instructions on how to construct the multiblock.\n\nRF is input through the top, and items can be pushed in and out from the appropriate Conveyor Belts. Place a Mold onto the Metal Press by right clicking it.\n\nThe Plate Mold has a crafting recipe, you don\u0027t need to use the Engineer\u0027s Workbench.\n\nItems are processed slowly, so it\u0027s recommended to use a Hopper to insert items rather than Conveyor Belts.\n\nThe Metal Press is 3x3x1.

continuum.crusher.name=Crushinator
continuum.crusher.desc=The Crusher is a multoblock machine that doubles ores and kill mobs. See the Engineer's Manual or the Projector for instructions on how to construct the multiblock.\n\nItems (and mobs) are input through the top, and must be thrown in as entities. It outputs from the bottom front block; if there is no inventory for it to go into, it gets thrown as an entity. Power is input on the right side on the top, and you can disable the machine on the left side.\n\nThe Crusher is 3x3x5.

continuum.steam.name=Steampunk
continuum.steam.desc=Certain EFab recipes require Steam. Getting a functioning EFab Steam setup requires a Boiler above a heat source (Lava, Fire, or Magma), a Steam Engine, and a Tank with water in it.

continuum.cable.name=Covered Cable
continuum.cable.desc=These Cables allow you to transfer a higher amount of RF/t. Each tier of cable is better than the last, transferring more RF/t as you go higher. Tiers do not affect machines at all, they only change the amount of RF/t that transfers.\n\nUninsulated Cables will damage you if you touch them while RF is passing through it, while Insulated Cables will not.\n\nThe tier order for the Cable is Tin < Copper < Gold < HV < Glass Fiber.

continuum.water_wheel.name=Passive Power
continuum.water_wheel.desc=The Water Wheel is a good way to passively generate power. That means it creates RF essentially for free, but they don't do it very quickly. They are created by placing a Kinetic Dynamo, then placing the Water Wheel on the side facing you. RF is pulled out of the Kinetic Dynamo.\n\nThe Water Wheel generates RF based on the amount of water flowing on it. The more blocks of flowing water touching it, the more RF/t it creates. The optimal water placement will generate 30 RF/t per Water Wheel. A single Kinetic Dynamo can have 3 Water Wheels placed next to each other.

continuum.tool_forge.name=Advanced Tinkering
continuum.tool_forge.desc=The Tool Forge allows you to create more advanced Tinker's Construct tools, like the Hammer and Excavator. It otherwise functions identical to the Tool Station.

continuum.alloy_kiln.name='Allo, Alloy!
continuum.alloy_kiln.desc=The Alloy Kiln is a multiblock machine that allows you to make alloys using solid fuel instead of going through the Smeltery. \n\nCreate a 2x2x2 cube of Kiln Bricks and use an Engineer's Hammer on the face you wish to be the front.

continuum.industrial_blast_furnace.name=Stronger
continuum.industrial_blast_furnace.desc=The Industrial Blast Furnace is a multiblock machine that smelts the toughest metals, like Chrome, Titanium, and Tungsten.\n\nOnce you place the Industrial Blast Furnace, the GUI will have a button that will show you the blueprint for the rest of the multiblock. You can make the multiblock out of any combination of Machine Casing.\n\nThe temperature is based on the combination of Machine Casings. Starting at 0, each Standard Machine Casing adds 40, each Reinforced Machine Casing adds 68, and each Advanced Machine Casing adds 95.\n\nYou can fill the center two blocks with Lava source blocks to add another 500 heat. \n\nYou get Titanium from putting Bauxite Dust into the Industrial Electrolyzer.

continuum.mega_torch.name=Safety Torch
continuum.mega_torch.desc=The Mega Torch disables natural monster spawning within 64 blocks of itself. It does §n§o§r§onot §rdisable monster spawning from Spawners or Cursed Earth, or anything similar, it only stops mobs that would spawn due to low light level.

continuum.electronic_circuit.name=Monty Python's Flying Circuit
continuum.electronic_circuit.desc=The Electronic Circuit is required for pretty much every Tech Reborn machine.\n\nAt this point in the progression you can only use the Infusion recipe. Later you can use the EFab instead.

continuum.fluid_manipulation.name=Fluid Manipulation
continuum.fluid_manipulation.desc=The Magma Crucible melts items into fluids.\n\nThe Fluid Transposer can either empty items into its internal tank, or use the tank's contents to fill an item.\n\nRecipes that need a bucket of, say, Destabilized Redstone work using Cans or other similar items as well.

continuum.transfer_nodes.name=Herer to Therer
continuum.transfer_nodes.desc=Transfer Pipes and Nodes allow you to move items in a much easier and faster way than Conveyor Belts. Place the Node on the inventory/tank you wish to extract from and place a line of Transfer Pipes along the path you wish it to go, and connect it to the inventory/tank you wish to insert into. You can apply several upgrades and a Filter to Transfer Nodes by opening the Node's GUI and placing them inside.\n\nYou can also create Retrieval Nodes that function similarly, but extract from inventories/tanks connected via pipes and inserts into the inventory/tank it's placed on.\n\nItems do not go through Nodes like other pipes. Instead, the Node slowly searches for an inventory that it can send items to, and then teleports the items there.

continuum.leadstone_jetpack.name=Onwards and Upwards
continuum.leadstone_jetpack.desc=The Leadstone Jetpack is the first method of flight available. All the tiers of Jetpack have roughly the same flight speed, but higher tiers store much more than the previous tiers.\n\nYou can install Armor Plating on Jetpacks to give them protecetion as well as function. Higher tiers of Jetpack can have higher tiers of Armor Plating.

continuum.drill.name=Pierce the Heavens!
continuum.drill.desc=The Drill acts as a Pickaxe and Shovel, but never breaks and uses RF. Sneak right click the Drill to open the GUI, where you can install Augments. There are Augments that add Silk Touch or Fortune, increase XP given, increase the mining radius, and let you place blocks down without moving to them. Higher tier Augments require the previous tier also be installed, and you only have 5 slots, so choose carefully which you want. Augments can be removed at any time for no cost. You can also dye the Drill any of the 16 available colors. \n\nYou can also insert Batteries into the upgrade slots to increase the RF capacity of the Drill. \n\nUse the Energizer to charge the Drill.

continuum.industrial_electrolyzer.name=It's What Plants Crave!
continuum.industrial_electrolyzer.desc=The Industrial Electrolyzer creates fluids and dusts from other fluids and dusts. Input items in the bottom slot and, if required, put Empty Cells in the bottom left slot. With RF, the machine will process the items.\n\nThe Electrolyzer is one of the only ways to get certain materials like Chrome (from Ruby) and Titanium (from Bauxite).

continuum.void_ore_miner.name=Metallum Ex Vacui
continuum.void_ore_miner.desc=The Void Ore Miner is a multiblock machine that generates ores at the cost of RF. There are six tiers in total, each giving you more resources faster and costing more RF/t. You can further influence what ores you get by replacing the Clear Laser Lens with a colored one.\n\nThe first tier is 7x7x4, with the Controller taking the top middle slot. Once it's placed, you can use an Assembler on it and it will start to place the other components where they should go.\n\nOnce the Void Ore Miner is constructed, provide RF to the Controller block and it will start to generate ores and place them in any inventories touching it. For the Void Ore Miner to function, you have to have a clear sight to Bedrock from the Laser Lens downwards.

continuum.modular_storage.name=Modular Storage
continuum.modular_storage.desc=The Modular Storage block on its own does nothing, it needs to have a Storage Module inside of it to function. The first tier holds a maximum of 100 stacks, each tier adding another 100 stacks. With the Storage Module installed, the Modular Storage acts basically like a chest. Stacks do not automatically combine; if you put a stack of 32 Dirt and later another stack of 16, they will stay separate. Hit the Z button at the bottom of the GUI to combine the stacks. Above the Z button, you can change how the items are shown, be it a list, two columns, or stacks like most other inventories. The button directly to the right of that one changes the way the items are sorted (you can install a Generic Type Module to add more options). The G button will combine the items into groups depending on the way they are sorted.\n\nThe Remote Storage and its Module allow increased functionality. Place the Storage Module inside one of the spaces for it in the Remote Storage and place the other Module on the right of it, and it will bind them together. You can then place the RSM into a Module Storage (or even multiple of them) and it will access that Storage Module. You can even have multiple Storage Modules in a single Remote Storage, and so long as they all have an ID (they've been bound to any RSM), you can cycle between the Storage Modules by hitting the C at the bottom left of the Modular Storage GUI.\n\nThe Storage Scanner allows you to access all nearby inventories around itself remotely. Set the radius and hit the Scan button, and it will detect nearby inventories. Select an inventory from the list to access it. You can reorder the list using the buttons to the left of it. You can only insert items into inventories on the list that have the star enabled, and then you insert through the blue slot at the bottom left. It will enter the first acceptable inventory on the list, starting at the top. If you wish to specify which items go where, put filtered inventories at the top of the list. You can disable the star at the bottom left and it will instead insert items to whichever inventory is currently selected. You can select "All Routable" from the list and it will display every inventory with a star at once. 

continuum.machine_frame.name=Machina
continuum.machine_frame.desc=You can use Upgrade Kits on Thermal Expansion machines to increase their tier which makes them faster, hold more RF, and gives another Augment slot per tier. The tier list goes Basic -> Hardened -> Reinforced -> Signalum -> Resonant.\n\nCertain machines can have specialization Augments installed that change their function in some way. You can only have one specialization Augment per machine.

continuum.itemduct.name=Pretty Items
continuum.itemduct.desc=Itemducts are generally much better for transferring items than Transfer Nodes. Itemducts will instantly search for a place to send items and they will slowly make their way through.\n\nItemducts default to insert only, you have to apply a Servo where you want to pull from. Inside the Servo's GUI, you can set if it needs redstone to pull, and you can set a whitelist or blacklist. Higher tier Servos have more options and can pull more, faster.\n\nYou can use a Wrench to disconnect two Itemducts from each other so they do not interact.

continuum.auto_efab.name=Weapons of Mass Production
continuum.auto_efab.desc=To automate the EFab, every block on the right has to be a part of the EFab multiblock.\n\nSet the recipe to craft in the Crafter and put the ingredients into the Item Storage. Provide the Crafter with a redstone signal and it will begin to craft. You can have multiple separate Crafters running at once on a single Processor and Item Storage, but you may want to add more Item Storages if you run out of storage space.\n\nThe number of Processors effects the speed that items are crafted.

continuum.void_ore_miner_2.name=Metallum Ex Vacui II
continuum.void_ore_miner_2.desc=The Tier 2 Void Ore Miner can generate a larger variety of materials. To upgrade the machine, you will have to tear the whole thing down, using those parts to create the next tier.\n\nThe Tier 2 Void Ore Miner is 7x7x5, with the Controller as the top middle block. From tier 2 and onwards, you can install various upgrades to the machines by replacing the Null Modifiers in the machine with other Modifiers.\n\nThe Accuracy Modifier increases the percent chance to get ores based on the color Lens and the Speed Modifier decreases the time it takes to generate ores.

continuum.refined_storage.name=Cyber Storage
continuum.refined_storage.desc=Refined Storage allows you to store large amounts of items digitally. You will only be able to store items, autocrafting comes later when you can set up an ME System.\n\nThe Controller is the brain of the system, and also where the system is powered. Everything must be a connected to the Controller in some way to work. Use Cables to connect the Controller to the other parts of the RS System. You can only have one Controller per RS system.\n\nThe Solderer crafts several important items. You can insert and extract from any side. Power it through the Controller. You can install Speed Upgrades into the 4 slots at the top right to make it faster.\n\nThe Disk Drive stores Storage Disks (higher tiers \u003d more items stored).

continuum.translocators.name=Ahorita Regreso
continuum.translocators.desc=Translocators are useful for very fast transfer over a very small distance (in fact, an upgraded Translocator is the fastest way to transfer items and fluids). There's a maximum range of 1 block between the input and the output. \n\nPlace Translocators on all blocks you want to be connected - the Translocators themselves must be in the same block space. Right click the middle of the Translocator with an empty hand to toggle insert mode, and it will pull from Translocators not in insert mode into that inventory/tank. Right click with a full hand and you can set filters on what can get inserted.\n\nYou can use a Glowstone Dust on the Translocator to make it pull a stack at a time, and a Redstone Dust to allow you to toggle insert mode with a redstone signal. \n\nA Diamond Nugget will allow you to set it to maintain the specified amount of the item inside and no more. \n\nThe filter on an inserting Translocator will restrict what can enter, while a filter on an outputting filter will eject items that are not in the filter. \n\nUsing an Iron Nugget will make it emit redstone based on certain factors - on an inserting Translocator it will emit if there's no room for items in the filter; on aan outputing Translocator it will emit if there's nowhere for the items in the filter to go.

continuum.phantomface.name=Transvectorface
continuum.phantomface.desc=The Phantomface allows you to access inventories from farther away than normal.

Later on you can use Advanced Rocket Engines which give much more thrust than the Liquid Fueled Engines do. The Guidance Computer tells the Rocket where to go. The Seat will allow you to ride the Rocket.\n\nThe Rocket Assembling Machine needs to be placed near or on the Launch Pad and provided with RF. With it, you can hit the Scan button to see if the Rocket is able to fly and then you can Build it if it is, turning the Rocket from a bunch of blocks to a single Rocket entity. It will tell you the amount of thrust you have, the weight of the ship, the fuel consumption, and how fast it takes off.\n\nThe Fueling Machine will fill up the Rocket it is linked to with Fuel from its internal tank. Sneak use a Linker on the Fueling Station then use it on the Rocket entity or Rocket Assembling Machine block to link the two.\n\nSneak use the Rocket entity (or sit in it and hit the "Open Rocket GUI" button) and click on the Guidance Computer and insert an unprogrammed Planet ID Chip. You can then hit the Select Dst button on the Rocket's GUI to select your destination by clicking on the body you wish to go to and hitting the Select button at the top left. You can hit the Up button to go up a level to focus on the thing the current body is orbitting. A Rocket alone can only travel between a body and its moons.\n\nDon't leave the planet unless you have enough fuel to get home (you can use a Pressure Tank filled with Fuel on the Rocket to fuel it on the go). If you are ready, you can set off and fly to the moon!

continuum.moon.name=Fly Me To The Moon
continuum.moon.desc=Luna, the Earth's only moon, is a barren wasteland. It's surface is made of Moon Turf, though a few blocks down it becomes Stone with normal ore generation.\n\nIf you explore enough, you might find the Apollo 11 landing site!

continuum.space_station.name=Space Base
continuum.space_station.desc=Now that you have a means of getting into space, you can begin to construct your Space Station. Make another platform out of Landing Pads and construct what you want to send up into space on top. This won't be flown up like the rocket, it will be stored as an item and built later.\n\nOnce you are happy with your Space Station (you can make changes later once it's in orbit), place down a Space Station Assembler like you did with the Rocket Assembling Machine. Put a Satellite Bay and an unprogrammed Space Station ID Chip inside and hit Scan. If the Space Station was constructed correctly, you can Build the Station and the blocks will be removed and stored inside of a Space Station Container inside the Space Station Assembler along with the Space Station ID Chip that is programmed to the new Space Station. \n\nIt is extremely recommended to copy your Space Station ID Chip in a Satellite Builder by putting the programmed one in the center top slot and the unprogrammed one in the slot to the right, then hitting the "Write to Secondary Chip" button, which programs the second one with the data on the first. Store this second one somewhere so you don't lose the ability to fly to your Space Station.\n\nPlace a second Satellite Bay onto your Rocket and insert the Space Station Container, then in the Guidance Computer insert the programmed Space Station ID Chip. You can now ride the Rocket up into orbit and it will land on top of the built Space Station. Rockets that have a programmed Space Station ID Chip will always fly between the Space Station and whatever it is orbitting.

continuum.co2_scrubber.name=Gasp
continuum.co2_scrubber.desc=In case you hadn't noticed, there's no air in space. You might have your Space Suit, but that could run out of Oxygen at any time. You can use the CO2 Scrubber and Oxygen Vent to give your Space Station some breathable air.\n\nPlace CO2 Scrubbers touching two sides of an Oxygen Vent and place Carbon Collector Cartridges in each, and provide the Oxygen Vent with RF. Give the Oxygen Vent a redstone signal (or tell it to work without one) and the air will become breathable. The Carbon Collector Cartridges lose durability over time but should last about 24 real hours.\n\nYou may want to make small airlocks by making a room with 2 Small Airlock Doors where only one opens at a time, one inside the Space Station and one facing the vacuum.

continuum.orientation_controller.name=Why Are You Upside Down, Soldier?
continuum.orientation_controller.desc=The Orientation Controller allows you to change the orientation of the Space Station. When placed down, in the GUI you can set the angular velocity in the X and Z directions, which will make the Space Station spin in that direction.

continuum.space_elevator.name=Stairway to Heaven
continuum.space_elevator.desc=The Space Elevator is a convenient way to travel within a system (a planet and anything orbitting it) without having to fly your Rocket every time. You need to have a Space Elevator at both locations, not just one. It costs 50,000 RF to send a player from a Space Elevator, but none to receive a player.\n\nYou have to connect Space Elevators together before you can travel between them. Insert an Elevator Chip into each then connect the two Space Elevator blocks with a Linker.\n\nAs with all Advanced Rocketry multiblocks, you can use different tiers of materials used in the Space Elevator. In this case the Stone can also be replaced with different blocks to make the Space Elevator go faster. See the Holo-Projector for a list of what else you can use instead of Stone.\n\nYou can not use a Space Elevator to travel within the same dimension.

continuum.warp.name=Prepare Ship for Ludicrous Speed
continuum.warp.desc=To travel to other planets and solar systems, you have to turn your Space Station into a Starship. This is done by placing a Warp Core and Warp Controller inside of the Space Ship.\n\nConstruct the Warp Core and insert Dilithium Crystals into the Input Hatch, then place the Warp Controller. In the Warp Controller you can choose whatever planet in whatever solar system you want to travel to. Warping requires more Dilithium if you are trying to reach planets that are farther away.\n\nThe Starship travels depending on the orientation of the Warp Controller. If you place the Warp Controller sideways, the Starship will travel sideways.\n\nPlanets need to be discovered before you can warp to them. You have to have at least 100 of each Data in the Warp Controller before you can scan for a planet, and there's only a 1/2 chance that the scan will be successful. You can insert an unprogrammed Planet ID Chip into the Warp Controller and it will be programmed with the planet you've discovered, which you can then remove and store. You can share programmed Planet ID Chips by inserting them into other Warp Controllers and clicking the "Program from Chip" button to discover that planet without having to scan for it. The planet you discover is randomly selected from all available undiscovered planets.\n\nCertain planets can not be warped to without having the required "artifact" inside the Warp Controller. Insert the artifact into the "Planet Tracking" tab.

continuum.satellite.name=Data Analytica
continuum.satellite.desc=Place the Satellite Builder with a Power Tap beneath it. \n\nAll Satellites need a Satellite ID Chip and a Solar Panel, either Basic or Large. There are several types of Satellites. Some collect Data, some produce energy, and some do some other utility.\n\nThere are three types of Data you can collect: Optics, Composition, and Mass.\n\nInsert the Satellite Chassis into the top left slot of the Satellite Builder GUI, a Satellite ID Chip in the slot one to the right, and fill the IO slots with Data Storage Units, then fill the slots above those with either Solar Panels or Batteries.\n\nTo determine the type of satellite, insert the item for that type in the top right slot. An Optical Sensor will collect data about how far away planets are, Composition Sensors will collect data about what planets are made of, and Mass Detectors will collect data about a planet's mass. A Satellite can only have one of these installed. \n\nTake the completed Satellite and the programmed Satellite ID Chip out of the Satellite Builder and insert the Satellite into a Satellite Bay on a Rocket and the Satellite will be placed into orbit the next time the Rocket launches.\n\nYou can launch an unmanned rocket using the Rocket Monitoring Station. Unmanned rockets are basically the same as regular rockets, but without seats. Use the Linking Tool to connect the Rocket Monitoring Station to the rocket. Inside the GUI, you can see the rocket's current altitude, velocity, and fuel level. Click the Launch button to launch the rocket.\n\nYou can copy ID Chips of all kinds with the Satellite Builder by placing a programmed ID Chip in the top center slot and an unprogrammed one in the slot to the right then hitting the "Write to Secondary Chip" button.\n\nInsert the programmed Satellite ID Chip into the top right slot of a Satellite Terminal to wirelessly connect to it, showing you the amount and type of Data it's collected so far. You can take the Data out by clicking the "Connect" button then inserting a Data Storage Unit and clicking on the arrow pointing down.

These asteroids are useful because they can be mined for materials, although not very much usually. There's a small change to find Iridium Ore on Enriched Asteroids. Give it Distance Data then hit "Scan" in the second tab. The range is dependant on the type of Motor used and if Glass or Lenses are used.\n\nTo store the coordinates of an Asteroid, insert an Asteroid ID Chip into the bottom left slot of the second tab while the Asteroid you want to mine is selected and click the "Process discovery" button. \n\nThe Programmed Asteroid ID Chip needs to be filled with a lot of Data which is done by inserting it into the bottom slot of the Astrobody Data Processor and filling all three switches in the GUI. 

continuum.asteroid_mining.name=Piercing the Heavens
continuum.asteroid_mining.desc=Now that our Satellite ID Chip is programmed and full of Data, we can begin the asteroid mining mission. This will require a specially built Rocket.\n\nThis Rocket needs to have Chests and Drills anywhere on it in addition to the rest of the normal Rocket things. The more Drills installed, the faster the mining mission is. \n\nInsert the Satellite ID Chip into the Guidance Computer and launch the Rocket using a Rocket Monitoring Station (don't ride it!) and it will begin the mission. In the Rocket Monitoring Station you can see how done the mission is. Once it's done, the Rocket will return to the Launch Pad ready for the next mission. \n\nUse a Rocket Unloader linked to the Rocket to automatically pull the items out.

continuum.quantum_network_bridge.desc=The ME Quantum Network Bridge is a multiblock machine that works in pairs and allows you to connect to your ME System across dimensions and long distances.\n\nFirst you need a set of Quantum Entangled Singularities. These are created by throwing a Singularity and an Ender Dust on the ground and exploding it. This will turn them into 2 Quantum Entangled Singularities. It is recommended to rename these so you don't confuse where they go.\n\nYou need a Quantum Network Bridge at the main ME System and another at the place you want to access it. The multiblock is formed by creating a hollow 3x3 of ME Quantum Rings with an ME Quantum Link Chamber in the center. Insert each of the paired Quantum Entangled Singularities to connect the two.\n\nThe Quantum Network Bridge at your main base gets powered by the Controller there. To power the Quantum Network Bridge at the other end, it is recommended to connect a Controller using Quartz Fiber, which transfer power but not storage data. That way, the second Controller won't be part of the ME System and so won't disable the Controller at your base, but will provide power.
