omnifactory.quest.db.4.title=铁资源储备
omnifactory.quest.db.4.desc=§5全能工厂§f中的§c矿石§r都是以大量聚集，或称“§e矿脉§f”的形式出现的。这些矿脉零散分布于世界各处，且较为常见。你物品栏中的§a扫描器§f可在以你自身为中心，半径16格的区域内搜寻所有种类的矿石。向下采掘并扫描即可显示出你身边所有的矿石。不妨现在就试着手持扫描器并按住§6右键§f直至进度条显示完成。%n%n虽然扫描器的工作需要消耗电量，但接下来本任务书将引导你制作一个用以为物品栏中的电力工具充能的§a通量电容§f，而扫描器中存储的电量并不太可能在此之前就消耗殆尽。%n%n你需要定位一处§6铁§f来源以便向前推进。生成在较高处，蕴含着铁、§6钒§f与§6金§f的§6磁铁矿§f矿脉、包含数种铁化合物的§6褐铁矿§f矿脉，以及在若干种矿脉中均可发现的，与§6铜§f伴生的§6黄铁矿§f都是很好的选择。%n%n§e将铁二次熔炼§f即可制得§6锻铁§f。锻铁具有比铁更高的耐久度，故更适合制作工具，但§c切勿将你储备的所有铁全部处理为锻铁§f。这两种材料并不互通且都要按需参与各种配方。

omnifactory.quest.db.9.title=双倍矿产？
omnifactory.quest.db.9.desc=在大多数专业级的整合包里，人们都有一个习惯：能够倍产矿物之前会尽可能保证直接处理的矿石越少越好。%n%n§e在全能工厂，你大可不必有这种压力。§f矿脉都很大，§a采矿锤§f挖起矿来也相当快，况且就算你有了§3研磨机§f，它也是需要耗时耗电的。%n%n话虽如此，存量稀少的材料和你花费§d全能币§f买来的东西，如果条件允许，还是值得走倍产处理的，毕竟它们不是白来的。%n%n但最起码在现在，把常见的矿石直接放进熔炉里烧可不是什么丑事！§e在拥有中压甚至更高电压等级的机器之前，你完全可以把矿物倍产抛在脑后。§r

Cutting blocks into 9 plates is much faster than using a §3Compressor§r to make them one at a time, and some plates can't be made in a Compressor at all.%n%nThe blade will require you to make §6Cobalt Brass§r. §6Cobalt§r is a byproduct obtained (likely first as tiny piles) from processing any of various ores, §6Zinc§r you should have already from electrolyzing §6Sphalerite§r, and the other materials are just §6Copper§r and §6Aluminium§r. If you're having trouble, keep in mind that §bJEI§r has a tab for ore processing byproducts that you can get to by looking up recipes for the regular-sized dust.%n%nCutting Machines work with plain §9Water§r for all recipes. You can also use §9Distilled Water§r which speeds up the processing somewhat, or §9Lubricant§r that speeds it up greatly (and uses very little per operation).

When you're ready to move on to HV recipes in the EBF, you'll want to move up to HV Energy Input Hatches, and so on.%n%nHowever, remember to keep the MV area separate from your LV area. §eHooking up an LV machine to MV current will result in the machine being destroyed! Also LV cables will burn up if you put MV current through them§r. That's why it's probably best to keep the areas separate until you're comfortable and confident with voltages. Eventually you can use transformers to switch voltages within a single setup, but don't feel forced to try that until you've got a grasp on the basics.%n%nAll RF power is the same (it has no voltages), so you can use RF conduits to route power from wherever you're generating and storing it to §3CEFs§r for each voltage. You don't have to use this setup, but it's the most foolproof one for a beginner.

omnifactory.quest.db.227.desc=Here comes the chemistry.%n%nIt might seem crazy right now, but you'll want a dedicated §3Chemical Reactor§r for pretty much every chemical you want to process.

omnifactory.quest.db.228.desc=Yes, Snad.%n%nThis pack has §aSnad§r, which is simply a sand-like block that instantly grows sugar cane/cactus on top of it when it receives either a block update or a redstone update.%n%nThe sugar cane it produces can be used as a fuel for your dynamos, and later you can even brew it for §9Biomass§r.%n%nThis quest calls for a §aRedstone Timer§r, but there are other ways to make snad grow sugar cane even faster (like a vanilla observer clock pointing into the Snad). Make sure to set the timer to pulse as fast as possible.%n%nTo collect the sugar cane, you can use a piston and an observer. Later you can make an §6Auto-Breaker§r from §bActually Additions§r, which works even better and doesn't spill sugar cane everywhere.%n%nFor now, a §3Vacuum Chest§r should help keep the floor clean, and causes less lag than Hoppers. A §aVoid Upgrade§r in a §6Storage Drawer§r will automatically delete any items that overflow the drawer's capacity, so it's a good way to ensure you don't crash your server from accumulating a massive sugar cane pile before safer block breakers are available to you.

These will be crucial going forward for making a variety of components and machinery.%n%nMake sure your power generation and circuit production are up to the challenge. It is useful to make at least two of these to avoid recipe conflicts and for different programmed circuits.%n%nNotice that all numbers of required items are §emultiples of 12§r. This is to make an Assembly Line that's 12 units long, allowing for 11 inputs and one output. This is a large enough Assembly Line to make a §aFusion Reactor Controller Mk1§r, but you'll need to expand to more inputs for later projects.%n%n§aFluid Input Hatches§r can replace any of the §6Steel Casings§r along the bottom outside except for the Casings touching the §aOutput Bus§r. For the most part, ULV ones work fine, but a few recipes will need an LV one.%n%nThe §aEnergy Input Hatches§r along the top can be replaced by Steel Casings: you only need the one Energy Input Hatch (although you can add more if you want).%n%nThe §aInput Buses§r along the bottom §emust be ULV tier§r, nothing else. Make sure to spin them all so the hole is on the bottom.

omnifactory.quest.db.287.title=Fusion Reactor MK1
omnifactory.quest.db.287.desc=Time to get fusing!%n%nThe §3Fusion Reactor§r is a multiblock that uses enormous amounts of energy to fuse fluids into new elements. This one is less flexible than the previous GregTech multiblocks, as you can only put hatches where the preview shows. §6Sneak-right click§r the controller to enable the in-world preview.%n%nThe §bJEI§r preview shows §e§eall valid hatch locations§r, but you don't actually need that many fluid hatches. You can replace any of the hatch positions in the structure with §6LuV Machine Casings§r, as long as you have at least §atwo Fluid Input Hatches§r and §aone Fluid Output Hatch§r. It's possible to use input/output hatches in every valid location, if you prefer.%n%nBecause of this, the quest only asks for §a80 LuV Machine Casings§r. If you want to use the minimum number of fluid hatches, you'll need to craft an additional §a28 casings§r.%n%nEach §aEnergy Input Hatch§r increases the reactor's power buffer. §aAll 16 Energy Input Hatches§r are required to be able to process all Mark 1 recipes and give a power buffer of §e160M EU§r.%n%nIn addition to the recipe power drain, Fusion Reactors have a §eheat§r mechanic related to the recipe's §e"Eu to Start"§r. This amount of power is drained from the reactor's buffer before starting the recipe to heat up the reactor to the necessary temperature, and is independent of the recipe's EU/t cost. As such, this determines the minimum tier of reactor you need for a recipe.%n%nIf the reactor stops processing, it will §erapidly lose heat§r, even if you pause it with a soft hammer. On the other hand, if the reactor is already at the required temperature for a recipe, §eno additional power§r is required to heat up the reactor! This is true even if you switch between different recipes. This mechanic incentivizes continuous use of the reactor.%n%nIf you switch to a recipe that requires more heat, §eonly the difference§r in heat values is consumed as EU to reach the target heat (up to a maximum heat equal to the reactor's current buffer).%n%nFusion Reactors don't overclock, and they gate the next tier of materials, so you will eventually want to make more than one.

Alternatively, reactors can be designed to produce a decent amount of power for the mid game of the pack.%n%nFirst, set up your 54 §6Reactor Casings§r to encase a 3x3 cube shape of empty air.

In the middle layer, place the 4 §6Graphite Blocks§r on the corners, and the 4 §6Glowstone Coolers§r on the sides (so they touch both Lapis Coolers).

omnifactory.quest.db.536.title=ZPM Machine Hulls
omnifactory.quest.db.536.desc=§6ZPM Machine Hulls§r are made with §6Iridium Plates§r, but you'll notice they also need §9Polytetrafluoroethylene§r (more commonly known as Teflon™), a special plastic which will be required for all machine hulls going forward.%n%nZPM stands for Zero Point Module.%n%nThis is the last tier of machine that's sensible to produce before you reach the §dCreative Portable Tank§r. Multiblock hatches are a different matter: feel free to upgrade your §3EBF§rs to Ultimate Voltage, if you can handle the power drain.%n

omnifactory.quest.db.540.desc=The §3Extruder§r is an alternative way to form shapes from metal. §aExtruder Shapes§r are used for telling an Extruder which shape to make.%n%nExtruders are the only way to make certain things, like §6Large Pipes§r. Extruders use ingots, but are as efficient for making §6Gears§r as melting and solidifying.%n%nYou can also use Extruders to make things from other machines like plates and wires, but they are less efficient than using the dedicated machines for these purposes.

This defers the tower for a little while longer.%n%nHowever, the Distillation Tower is mandatory for advanced chemistry, as most things have more than one important output: §9Fermented Biomass§r, §9Charcoal Byproducts§r from your §3Pyrolyse Oven§r, and the entire line of petrochemicals from §9Oil§r, to name a few.%n%nCan't avoid it forever!%n%n

omnifactory.quest.db.547.title=扫描模块：方块
omnifactory.quest.db.547.desc=寻找特定矿石的最佳方法无异是为你的扫描器加装§6扫描模块：方块§r。手持该模块并§6潜行右击§f一块矿石来绑定，接着手持§a扫描器§f，再次§6潜行右击§f来打开模块界面，将绑定好的模块放入其中即可开始扫描。%n%n与扫描全部矿石时相比，通过该模块扫描特定方块的范围明显更大，并且如果你有§6末影珍珠§f，甚至可以再行合成并加装一个§6扫描模块：范围§f来进一步扩大扫描范围。%n%n你可以把用§d全能币§f买来的矿石作为用以绑定的“样本”，与加装了方块模块的扫描器组合使用，便能轻松找到你想要的一整条矿脉。

The Pipes only have a 1%% chance to break per bucket of §9Oil§r drilled.%n%nYou'll need to supply at least §eHV power§r to your rig, and it will overclock with higher energy tiers. Positions of hatches and buses can be swapped with any §6Solid Steel Machine Casing§r.%n%nIf the multiblock preview in §bJEI§r is confusing, note that you can §ehold shift and drag-right-click§r to scale the preview to fit the window.

It will consume fuel faster to produce a correspondingly higher RF per tick.%n%nEach augment increases both base power production and fuel consumption by 100%%, additively (so the second is 200%%, third is 300%%, etc.).%n%nConsider the tradeoffs however, as you could just make another dynamo, and you miss out on §aFuel Catalyzer§r augments that make fuels burn longer for more total RF generated. The Auxiliary Transmission Coil will put additional stress your fuel production infrastructure.%n%nIf that's an acceptable tradeoff, then Auxiliary Transmission Coils are a cheap and effective way to boost your power production.

You'll need to manage the logistics of routing and storing all the different fluids you're automating.%n%nWherever possible, having one Chemical Reactor output directly into another machine that needs its output chemical saves you from having to figure out additional storage and routing. §aFluid Filters§r and §aPump covers§r are very useful for moving fluids around a compact processing pipeline.%n%nBut what about the final output fluids that you need elsewhere?%n%nOne option is to use the output tanks of the Chemical Reactors as a small storage buffer, letting it back up and stop crafting automatically. A §aFluid Storage Bus§r on the machine will expose the fluid to your ME Network. Whenever you need some of this fluid, your AE2 system will pull the needed fluid out and the machine will resume processing.%n%nThere's some catches with this approach though. First is that the inaccessible input tanks will also show up in AE but you won't be able to access them. You will want to set the Storage Bus to §eExport Only§r so AE doesn't try to store random fluids in the Chemical Reactor, and you may want to §ereduce the priority§r of the Storage Bus as well: this will signal to AE that you want it to remove fluids from that location first. Also, if multiple fluids are produced, §ethe machine will not resume processing if it doesn't have room for all fluid outputs§r.%n%nWhen you get access to them, it's probably just better to use single-fluid-formatted §aFluid Storage Cells§r and dump outputs into AE via Fluid Interfaces. You can fill up the cells, then pull the fluids out wherever else you need them.%n%n

omnifactory.quest.db.787.title=Farming Station
omnifactory.quest.db.787.desc=The §3Farming Station§r is a machine that automates growing and harvesting trees and crops around it, based on what items you put in it.%n%nThe Farming Station will principally collect crops, saplings, and wood, but it will also collect things like §6Apples§r from Oak Trees and §6Sticky Resin§r from Rubber Trees. It can also collect leaves if you want it to.%n%nLike other §bEnderIO§r machines, it requires an §6RF capacitor§r. The quality of capacitor affects the overall size of the farm as well as the speed and energy at which it operates.%n%nYou can configure which crops or tree types will be planted relative to the Farming Station by placing the crop or sapling in the various quadrants in the GUI. Clicking the lock button will ensure that the stack placed there won't be completely consumed, as that could lead to plants migrating to other quadrants.%n%nIn addition to power, the Farming Station§r requires specific §etools§r (and usually a supply of §9Water§r) to operate. If you're missing anything, the machine will refuse to operate and displays a message over itself to let you know.%n%nFor planting §6crops§r or §6saplings§r, you need a §aHoe§r.%nFor chopping §6trees§r, you need an §aAxe§r. To collect §6leaves§r, you also need §aShears§r.%n%nTool durability is consumed as the farm performs work, so the tools will eventually break. You can make §aStone Tools§r from a cobblestone generator and some sticks, or even §aDiamond Tools§r using diamonds from your §3Deep Mob Learning§r setup.%n%nAlternately, you can invest in fancier tools such as th§re §aDark Backhoe§r (which is designed for use in the Farming Station), or even unbreakable tools much later like the §aFlux Infused Axe§r and §aOmniwrench§r (shears).%n%nThe Farming Station also has a lesser-known feature: it respects enchantments and upgrades on your tools. Tools with §eEmpowered§r upgrades will be ejected into the output slots when they run out of charge (if they don't break first). Tools with the §eMending§r enchantment are similarly ejected when they are about to break.%n%nYou can use these properties to your advantage.%n%n

omnifactory.quest.db.788.title=Smart Item Filter
omnifactory.quest.db.788.desc=The §6Smart Item Filter§r from §3GregTech§r is an important tool when automating otherwise troublesome machines. It is a cover which filters item transfer based on whether a valid recipe exists for those items in a specified machine.%n%nThis is powerful in combination with movement covers like the §6Robot Arm§r. If you place this filter on the §eElectrolyzer§r mode in a Robot Arm set to §eSupply Exact§r mode, the Robot Arm will transfer precisely the right amounts of all valid items into an §3Electrolyzer§r so it will operate without clogging. There's no other way to accomplish this feat!%n%nThis filter also has §eSifter§r and §eCentrifuge§r§r modes for use with those machines (though §3Sifters§r are not in §5Omnifactory§r). It does not have modes for any other machines.%n%nThe §eDefault§r button lets you click it to §eIgnore Fluids§r, which is useful when you have recipes that also require fluids (like §9Hydrogen§r in an Electrolyzer). Since Robot Arms can't move fluids, it would otherwise prevent the cover from working.%n

# db 789
omnifactory.quest.db.789.title=Filters
omnifactory.quest.db.789.desc=§aFilters§r are a type of machine cover that controls what items or fluids are allowed to pass through it. They can be used directly on the side of a machine to affect external automation or the Machine's §aAuto-Output Functionality§r.%n%nYou can also §eplace filters inside of other covers§r to control what items or fluids that cover will interact with. When used in a §6Robot Arm§r, §aItem Filters§r make for a powerful automation tool for §ekeeping specific items in stock§r in specific quantities in Machines. With §6Fluid Regulators§r, similar behavior is possible with fluids using a §aFluid Filter§r. For §6Conveyors§r and §6Pumps§r, it simply limits what that cover will move.%n%n§aFilters§r all have 9 configurable slots and whitelist/blacklist modes, and can be applied to multiple sides of machines. When placed inside a §6Robot Arm§r in §eKeep Exact§r or §eSupply Exact§r mode§r, the item count in a filter can be incremented by §eRight Clicking§r and decremented by §eLeft Clicking§r. Holding §eShift§r causes the count to increase/decrease by a factor of 2. This controls the number of each type of item that will be kept in stock or moved at a time.%n%nSimilar controls are available for the §aFluid Filter§r when placed inside a §6Fluid Regulator§r.%n%nAdditionally, the §aOre Dictionary Filter§r§r is a powerful tool that has a specialized filter which uses ore dictionary entries and supports "*" as a wildcard, e. g. "§6ingotHot*§r" will match all hot ingots, "§6dustRegular*§r" will match all regular dusts, and "§6dustTiny*§r" will match all tiny piles.%n%nAll §bGregTech§r Filters can be configured using ghost items from §bJEI§r.

omnifactory.quest.db.790.desc=§6机器控制覆盖板§r能够管理§b格雷科技§r机器的运作，类似于§a软锤§r。这种覆盖板对于§e被动自动化§r（使一台机器专门用于保持某件物品有足量的库存）来说至关重要。%n%n这里所说的“机器”所指的东西比你可能会想到的要多。单方块机器自不用说，而§3电力高炉§r等§e多方块机器§r的§e控制器§r亦包括在内。除此之外，先行在兼容的§b格雷科技§r方块上加装传输类覆盖板后，你便可为其额外加装机器控制覆盖板！也就是说，它也适用于§6箱子§r、§6桶§r和多方块结构组成方块等等。%n%n这种覆盖板会通过探测§e红石信号§r来控制机器运作。默认情况下，覆盖板将在探测到足够强的红石信号时使整个机器停止运作。%n%n使用§a螺丝刀§r打开机器控制覆盖板的界面后，你可以看到若干用以配置具体行为的选项：%n%n顶部的滑块可调整触发覆盖板所需的最小红石信号强度。%n%n另一个按钮用以将控制目标设定为整台机器（若适用）或特定一面的覆盖板，使你不仅能够禁止物品从某个侧面输入机器，还能直接停止整台机器。%n%n在§e普通§r模式与§e反相§r模式之间切换可使得机器控制覆盖板的功能转变为在探测到足够强的红石信号时使整个机器开始运作。这一模式常与§6ME标准发信器§r搭配使用，在§eME网络§r处于离线状态时防止机器运作。%n%n使用案例：%n•使用原版的红石装置，或是一个简单的拉杆来控制机器运作；%n%n•输出目标为§b储物抽屉§r时使用§6红石升级§r使抽屉发出红石信号来控制机器；%n%n•发展至数字存储时，§6ME标准发信器§r或§6ME流体标准发信器§r可依照网络中特定物品或流体的存储量发出红石信号，进而通过机器控制覆盖板来控制机器。%n

omnifactory.quest.db.791.title=Processing Array
omnifactory.quest.db.791.desc=The §6Processing Array§r is a §bGregTech§r multiblock that allows for processing multiple recipes in parallel in a single stucture and is extremely useful for saving space.%n%nUp to 16 of the same recipe can be processed in parallel by placing the machines for the recipe in exactly one §aMachine Access Interface§r in the multiblock structure, as well as the ingredients and non-consumable items (like §6Integrated Circuits§r) for the recipe you want to process in one or more input buses. While a recipe is running, the Machine Access Interface is §elocked§r and machines cannot be added or removed.%n%nNote that each machine will still draw the full voltage required for the recipe, which may be more than a single §aEnergy Input Hatch§r can provide. This is why the §6Processing Array§r has an astounding Hatch limit, and can support up to §e8 Energy Inputs§r on the structure. This allows you to get the needed 16 Amps of power to the machine from a single tier-appropriate §3CEF§r.%n%nProcessing Arrays distribute their buffered power at the appropriate voltage, so there's no danger of your machines exploding if you, for example, operate 16 HV machines off one amp of IV power.%n%nBecause the required number of Inputs, Outputs, and Casings is highly variable, this quest only asks you to craft the §6Processing Array Controller§r and the §aMachine Access Interface§r. Make sure your buses and hatches are large enough to hold the ingredients and outputs for the number of parallel crafts you're attempting, and that you're providing enough power for all those machines!%n%nAn advanced feature of the Processing Array is §eDistinct Bus Mode§r. This makes the Processing Array only consider a single item input bus at a time when determining whether it can run a recipe. This is useful when recipes for a particular machine require different catalyst items, like §6Integrated Circuits§r on different configurations or §6Extruder Shapes§r.%n%nDistinct Bus Mode may be enabled or disabled via the Processing Array controller by clicking in the designated area.%n%n

You can throw dynamite to blow things up, but it is primarily a crafting ingredient you can use in the §3Implosion Compressor§r.%n%n§6TNT§r is another explosive that could be made instead of Dynamite. It's a stronger explosive so you need fewer TNT per recipe it's used in relative to dynamite, but it has its own unique processing chain.

omnifactory.quest.db.804.title=Assembly Line Automation
omnifactory.quest.db.804.desc=The §a§r§3Assembly Line§r is a particularly unusual multiblock from an automation standpoint. Up until now, it has been possible to dump ingredients into a single input bus. Clearly, this won't work for the Assembly line, since it has a whole bunch of ULV inputs buses that hold one item stack each.%n%nYou might be tempted to dump everything into a chest and route items around to specific buses with §aItem Conduits§r. You'll probably find this to be slow, prone to jamming, and inflexible when you want to run different recipes.%n%nIf you've unlocked §3§3The Empowerer§r§r, you might have considered §aPhantomfaces§r. These would certainly be an improvement over item conduits, but there's an even better solution.%n%nEnter §aItem Laser Relays§r§r: these handy tools from §bActually Additions§r allow you to create a virtual inventory out of multiple real ones; that is, you can use them to make other automation think that all of the input buses are the same inventory.%n%n§eOne important thing to note is that lasers appear to be "placed" on a particular block but they will interact with all adjacent (non-laser) blocks.§r Take this into account when placing them.%n%nTo start, place a laser on each of the input buses. Then, place the §a§aItem Interface§r adjacent to the laser on the first input bus. This will serve as the access point to the virtual inventory where you can connect things like an §3Unpackager§r or §aME Interface§r.%n%nTake your §aLaser Wrench§r and right click the first laser relay, then the second laser relay, to link them together. Repeat this with the second and third relays, third and fourth relays, etc. until they have all been linked together. Now you have a laser network virtualizing all of the input buses!%n%n§cWarning: be careful not to place a second laser on a laser network adjacent to the network's Item Interface. This will immediately crash your game because it creates a cycle in the network. You will have to either restore from backup or edit the level.dat directly to remove the block to play again.§r%n%nIf you need to do recipes with an §6§6Integrated Circuit§r, you can leave it in an input bus and skip placing a laser there. Remember to always use §eBlocking Mode§r when connecting the laser network to on-demand crafting. As long as you do, you can have §edifferent circuits in the Assembly Line without recipe conflicts§r. If you don't use Blocking Mode, you are likely to accidentally craft something else and jam your Assembly Line.
