Well, you may have noticed that it pulsates slightly. I noticed, when hooking it up to redstone, that the rate in which it pulsates depends on the strength of the redstone signal."

It seems the ender dust causes the iron to be more susceptible to merging with foreign materials. That's why we needed the ash... it's time to make an endersteel alloy. I dub thee: $(item)Dark Endersteel$()!"

It seems as though it'll stay the same forever, but the moment you change slightly the signal you pass in, it changes as well. This property, I believe, is what makes it so useful..."
