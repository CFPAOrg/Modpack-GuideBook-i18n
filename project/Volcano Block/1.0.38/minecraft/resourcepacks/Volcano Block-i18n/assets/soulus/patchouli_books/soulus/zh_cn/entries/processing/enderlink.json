However, it's perfect for quickly moving many things in a wide area to a tiny space. Are you picking up what I'm putting down? (Maybe not, but the enderlink definitely is.)$(p)Also, note, you can recolor the enderlink and the ender dust; the enderlink will only teleport things on dust of the same alignment."
