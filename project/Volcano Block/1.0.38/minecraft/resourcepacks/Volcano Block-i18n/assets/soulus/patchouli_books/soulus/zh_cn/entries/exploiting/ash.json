It's a necessary component for my favourite contraption, however, so we'll just have to figure something out.$(p)My main concern is that I have no idea what the world will look like for you, considering how much time will have passed. Will Plantae have retaken hold on the world?"

I spend my time researching Animalia, but Animalia is already not what it once was. As the world becomes less hospitable from our actions, species become extinct, and it's happening at a rate faster than I can restore."

It might not be enough, actually.$(p)What else... well, ideally, you would want a substance that can disintegrate something and leave behind the carbon. That's really what makes good ash. The problem is that I don't have the first idea what kind of substance that would be..."
