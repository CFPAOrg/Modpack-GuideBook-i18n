When a human kills a creature, an ancient magic of our world causes the creature to drop what we've dubbed 'experience'. Other special items are usually caused by the presence of a powerful (human) soul."

At this point, you're probably comfortable with throwing massive amounts of soulus around, correct? Well, if you insert a $(item)Soul Catalyst$() into the Skewer, the soul will be powerful enough for human drops."
